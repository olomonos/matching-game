This is a simple matching game. 

## Rules

- You should find the odd circle in the right part of the field.
- For every round, you have basically 7 sec. 
- But if you complete this round faster than in 7 sec, you'll get the rest of the time as a bonus in the next round.
- If you can't find the odd circle in time, the game is over.
